Then while the Immersion Blender is running, start adding in the Shredded Cheese and Cream Cheese. Blend until all the Cheese is incorporated. Now, stir in the Broccoli. Pulse a few times to break up the Broccoli. You can also skip this step, if you prefer your Broccoli whole. Taste for Seasoning."

- "Tip: If you&#39;d prefer to skip using flour, you can cube a large potato and cook it in the soup. Once soft, crush and stir or blend into the soup."
