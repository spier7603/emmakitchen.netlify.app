recipeingredient:
- "3-4 tbsp olive oil"
- "3 large bonein country style pork ribs they are actually cuts of pork shoulder"
- "1 yellow bell pepper thinly sliced optional"
- "8 oz. portobello mushrooms sliced 14 thick"
- "1 red onion thinly sliced"
- "5 cloves garlic roughly chopped"
- "1 clove garlic grated for finishing"
- "1-1/2  piece fresh ginger grated"
- "1-1/2 tbsp mild Korean chili flake"
- "1/2 tsp kosher sea salt"
- "1/2 tsp ground black pepper"
- "1-1/2 limes zest and juice"
- "1-2 tsp soy sauce"
- "1-2 tsp fish sauce"
- "1 tsp rice wine vinegar"
- "1-2 cups water"
- "1 lb tagliatelle or other wise flat noodle"
- "1/2 cup chopped fresh basil"
- "1/2 cup chopped fresh chives"
recipeinstructions:
- "Season the ribs all over with half of the salt, pepper, and chili flake. Rest at room temperature for at least 1-2 hours (or overnight in the refrigerator for the best results) to allow the salt time to penetrate to the interior of the meat. If refrigerating overnight, allow the ribs to come to room temperature before cooking."
- "Chop your vegetables ahead so they are ready to throw into the pan when the meat is cooked - slice the peppers and onions, chop and grate the garlic and ginger."
- "Heat the olive oil over medium-high heat and sear the ribs on all sides - 1-2 minutes per side to achieve a deep drown crust."
- "Remove the ribs from the pan and set on a plate to rest."
- "Turn the heat down to medium and add the onion, mushrooms, pepper, chopped garlic, and the remaining salt, pepper, and chili flake. Cook the vegetables for 10-12 minutes until they begin to soften and brown. Add the fish sauce and cook until the fishy smell is gone. It will smell very funky at first, but it will mellow out as it continues to cook. Add all but about a tsp of the ginger and continue to cook for a few more minutes until its very fragrant."
- "Add the soy sauce, rice wine vinegar, and lime juice to deglaze the pan - which just means loosening the flavorful brown bits on the bottom of the pan and incorporating them into the vegetables."
- "Nestle the ribs back into the pot amongst the vegetables and make sure they are mostly submerged in liquid. Add water as needed to make this happen. Simmer 1-2 hours until the meat is tender and easily pulled from the bones."
- "Break up the meat with the back of a spoon once it’s cooked. Fish out the bones with a pair of tongs. Stir in the grated garlic, lime zest, and remaining ginger."
- "Make the pasta when the pork is almost done. Cook until just under al dente. Transfer cooked pasta to the pot of pork with tongs, taking some pasta water along with it. Toss the pasta with the pork mixture to coat the pasta and evenly distribute the pork and mushrooms."
- "Stir in chopped basil and chives just before serving, saving a few teaspoons to sprinkle on top of each plate."
