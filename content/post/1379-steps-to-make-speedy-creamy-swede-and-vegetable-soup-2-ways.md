- " double cream"
- " Garnish optional"
recipeinstructions:
- "Chop the swede into small chunks. Place on a baking tray, drizzle with olive oil and season with salt, pepper and a pinch of mixed herbs. Bake in the oven 210c for 30 mins. Half way through cooking turn the cubes over so they cook evenly."
- "Meanwhile, cut the onion, celery and carrots into small cubes."
- "Heat the veg you have just chopped on a low heat for 5-10 mins until they start to soften, but before they start to colour. Take off heat once this is done."
- "Once the swede is cooked (soft without colouring) remove from the oven and add to the pan of mixed veg."
- "Make the stock per instructions. Add the pan. Allow it to come to the boil before turning the heat right down, add a lid and leave to slowly cook for 30 mins."
- "At this point you have two choices. If you like chunky soup, leave as it is. If you want a smooth texture add the soup to a bowl and blitz with a hand blender. If you want a creamy soup, add the cream after blending - leave a little to swirl on the top if you like. Have a taste and add more pepper if needed. Enjoy with sourdough bread and cheddar cheese!"
