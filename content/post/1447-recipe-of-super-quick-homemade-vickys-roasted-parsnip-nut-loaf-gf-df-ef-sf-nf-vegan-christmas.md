- "Cook off the spinach in some salted water for 5 minutes until wilted then drain and add to the swede pan"
- "When the parsnips are done, add them to the swede pan with the spinach, parsley, lemon juice, nuts and grated carrot, salt &amp; pepper to taste"

- "Mash everything together well. You should be able to form a moist ball in your hand with the mixture. If it&#39;s too wet, add some breadcrumbs or porridge oats to the mixture. Season to taste, you may wish to add more honey/agave"
- "Lightly oil an ovenproof dish or line with foil. Spoon the mixture in, pat down and cover with some more oiled foil and bake for 30 minutes then remove foil and continue baking for a further 15-20 minutes until the top starts to turn golden brown"
- "Let stand 10 minutes before slicing and serve hot with a nice salad, green veg or with some boiled potatoes and vegetable gravy"
- "You can also bake in a loaf tin or it&#39;s nice to put into individual ramekins or madeline moulds. Adjust the cooking time to 45 minutes covered and 15 uncovered if you use a loaf tin and reduce to 35 minutes total time if using individual mini loaf moulds"
- "This is a bit &#39;all about the timing&#39; but it&#39;s worth it. It&#39;s a great alternative to meatloaf"
