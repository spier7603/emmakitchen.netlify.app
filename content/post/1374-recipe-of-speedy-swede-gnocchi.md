recipeinstructions:
- "Peel your swede and chop into small cubes, this will allow the vegetable to cook quicker. In a frying pan add your olive oil and garlic and let this sizzle few minutes to season the oil. Add your swede and let toast a little in the oil. Remove the the garlic, add your ginger and start by adding a little water at the time. You can also use vegetable stock to enhance the flavour, but this is optional. Season with salt if using just water."
- "Cook the swede until softened but still holding its shape. Blend without adding any water to a puree and transfer in a bowl. You will have to try and work your ingredients when still warm for a soft consistency. Add your flour a little at the time helping yourselves with a fork first, until you can transfer the dough on a work surface."
- "You can decide your consistency. If you would like to boil your gnocchi, you could use less flour and transfer the mixture to a piping bag and can pipe your gnocchi directly in water. I cooked my in the pan hence wanted a more firm consistency. Make sure to work your dough quickly and cut in the preferred shape."
- "I served mine with a burnt butter sauce, which I seasoned myself hence using unsalted butter, crispy sage and romanesco for a crunch. Buon Appetito :)"
