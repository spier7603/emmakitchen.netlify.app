- "6 oz shiitake mushrooms  thinly sliced"
- "1/2 tsp dried whole thyme leaves"
- "1 tsp kosher salt  divided"

- "6 oz gouda cheese  shredded"
- "6 large eggs"
- "3/4 cup heavy whipping cream"
recipeinstructions:
- "Melt butter in a 10 inch skillet over medium heat. Add prepared mushrooms. Pinch the thyme between your fingers to crush slightly. Add to mushrooms along with 1/2 tsp of the salt and all of the pepper."
- "Sauteé mushrooms until they exude their juices and juices then evaporate. Stirring often. About 10 minutes. Turn off heat. Set aside and allow to cool completely."
- "When mushrooms are cool preheat oven to 350°F. Generously grease the bottom and sides of a 9 inch pie plate with the remaining 1/2 tbs butter. Set aside. Shred the gouda cheese and set aside, too."

- "Slowly pour egg mixture over mushrooms and cheese in a circular motion so as not to displace any of the filling. Give the pie plate a couple of gently shakes to ensure egg mixture is evenly dispersed and everything levels out."
- "Place quiche in oven. Bake 40-45 minutes or until top is golden and center just barely jiggles when you gently shake the pie plate. Remove from oven and let cool 10-15 minutes before cutting. Enjoy!"
